In this file, we abstract away details related to the active prompt.
Eventually, we may want to store these details in a database (or some other repository).
That database or repository would also be accessible to anyone doing evaluations on prompts and models.
This would allow us to decouple updates to active prompt from web application source code changes.
For now, this file is where all the (rudimentary) "prompt management" happens.
