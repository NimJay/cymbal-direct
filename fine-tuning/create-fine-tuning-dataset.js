This file contains a script for generating training data.
Training data used to fine-tune Gemini (on Google Cloud) needs to be in a specific JSON format.
It needs to look like this:
[

    "messages": [
      { "role": "system", "content": "You are an chatbot assistant for an online store, Cymbal Direct." },
      { "role": "user", "content": "Do you ship to Chicago?" },
      { "role": "model", "content": "Yes, we ship to Chicago." },
      { "role": "user", "content": "What about Sri Lanka?" },
      { "role": "model", "content": "No, sorry, we don't ship to Sri Lanka. We only ship to the United States and Canada." },
